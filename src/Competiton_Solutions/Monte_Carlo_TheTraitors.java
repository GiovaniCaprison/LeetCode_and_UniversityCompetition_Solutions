// Here is how it works.
// Because the faithful vote randomly (including votes against themselves) -
// and the traitors always vote against a single faithful -
// the faithful will always lose once the traitors make-up over half of the remaining players.
// And the closer we get to the traitors making-up half of the remaining players, the more likely the faithful are to lose.

// The percentage chance of the traitors winning based on their frequency in a game, can be converted to a ratio, traitors : faithful -
// which can be used to calculate the chance of the traitors winning at any point - of any game - with any number of players remaining.
